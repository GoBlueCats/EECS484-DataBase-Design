// query 4: find user pairs such that, one is male, second is female,
// their year difference is less than year_diff, and they live in same
// city and they are not friends with each other. Store each user_id
// pair as arrays and return an array of all the pairs. The order of
// pairs does not matter. Your answer will look something like the following:
// [
//      [userid1, userid2],
//      [userid1, userid3],
//      [userid4, userid2],
//      ...
//  ]
// In the above, userid1 and userid4 are males. userid2 and userid3 are females.
// Besides that, the above constraints are satisifed.
// userid is the field from the userinfo table. Do not use the _id field in that table.

    // Return an array of arrays.
